## Loopback address `127.0.0.1`
**Loopback Interface (`127.0.0.1`):** This is a *virtual interface* that allows a device to communicate with itself. It's often used for testing and troubleshooting.
The IP address `127.0.0.1` is the loopback address, commonly referred to as **localhost**. When a web server or any other application is configured to listen on `127.0.0.1`, it means it will ***only accept*** connections ***from the local machine.*** 
> This part ***from the local machine***  is very important because it means none other than the current device can access any service on that address. 
> So **devices in the LAN, can't connect** to the service on localhost (`127.0.0.1`).

## IP address `0.0.0.0`
The IP address `0.0.0.0` is a special value that has different meanings depending on the context in which it's used. In the context of networking and server configuration, when a server binds to `0.0.0.0`, it means the server will listen on all available network interfaces. In other words, it will accept connections from **any IP address**, whether it's the ***localhost (`127.0.0.1`)***, the ***local network (`192.168.x.x`)***, or any ***external IP*** address.
> If you want to set any service for your LAN, it's either best to serve at `192.168.x.x` or better at `0.0.0.0`. But beware of using it in `0.0.0.0` as there might be some security issues.
