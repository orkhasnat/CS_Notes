**Design patterns** are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.
The most basic and low-level patterns are often called *idioms*. They usually apply only to a single programming language. The most universal and high-level patterns are *architectural patterns*. Developers can implement these patterns in virtually any language. Unlike other patterns, they can be used to design the architecture of an entire application.
All patterns can be categorized by their *intent*, or purpose:
###### Creational patterns
They provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
###### Structural patterns
They explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
###### Behavioral patterns
They take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
